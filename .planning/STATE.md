## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Go for implementation (single binary, good CLI ecosystem)
- `resumed` over `resume-cli` (actively maintained)
- Project-based workflow with application folders (keeps jobs organized)
- Claude CLI via subprocess (no AI dependencies in binary)
- Versioned optimize output (supports iteration)
- ATS flag on optimize not generate (content strategy is writing concern)
- Auto-name application folders via Claude (reduces friction)
